# Token-audit
In this section is the audit of the token contract

The audit of the $GORI Token was carried out with the company Freshcoins. In this repository there are two audits because two tokens were made in this project.

The first audit was carried out on March 4, 2022, to the contract: 0x4Ac1071dde58316C5eCE2c23E20B8965c14Ec0e7

However, a correction had to be made to this token in the development of the project, due to a failure in the realization of the tokenomic when establishing the contracts for private sale, pre-sale and blocking contracts, since at the time of sending the token EXCLUDE_FEE was not made to the addresses of the generated contracts, causing a tokenomic disorder.

We are currently working on the $GORI token with the following contract address: 0x7F53DFEEafBBedD62DE88808D44D043866173a51

This token was audited with the company Freshcoins on May 28, 2022.

This is the official token of the project which you can verify on the Binance Smart Chain at the following link:
